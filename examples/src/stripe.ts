 * events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
 * customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
 * `charge.succeeded` event.
 *
 * Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event's data
 * field embeds the resource's state at the time of the change. For

 * [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how
 * to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)
 * so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.

 * that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there's an

 * Invoice

 * that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).
 *
 * If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
 * Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
 * that finalizing the invoice,
 * [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does
 * not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
 * until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
 * webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
 * connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
 * creation to finalize the invoice.
 *
 * If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
 * [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
 * Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
 * emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
 *
 * Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
 * amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
 * charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
 * per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
 * invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
 * customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.

 *
 * There are two types of PaymentMethodConfigurations. Which is used depends on the [charge type](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/charges):
 *
 * **Direct** configurations apply to payments created on your account, including Connect destination charges, Connect separate charges and transfers, and payments not involving Connect.
 *
 * **Child** configurations apply to payments created on your connected accounts using direct charges, and charges with the on_behalf_of parameter.
 *
 * Child configurations have a `parent` that sets default values and controls which settings connected accounts may override. You can specify a parent ID at payment time, and Stripe will automatically resolve the connected account’s associated child configuration. Parent configurations are [managed in the dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/connected_accounts) and are not available in this API.

 * SetupIntent
 * A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
 * For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
 * Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
 *
 * Create a SetupIntent when you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
 * Don't maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid.
 * The SetupIntent transitions through multiple [statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
 * you through the setup process.
 *
 * Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
 * For example, cardholders in [certain regions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might need to be run through
 * [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) during payment method collection
 * to streamline later [off-session payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents).
 * If you use the SetupIntent with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer),
 * it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup.
 * We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
 * PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
 *
 * By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even as regulations change over time.

 * To preview how the proration is calculated, use
 * the <a href="/docs/api/invoices/upcoming">upcoming invoice</a> endpoint.</p>
 *
 * <p>By default, we prorate subscription
 * changes. For example, if a customer signs up on May 1 for a <currency>100</currency> price, they’ll be billed
 * <currency>100</currency> immediately. If on May 15 they switch to a <currency>200</currency> price, then on June 1
 * they’ll be billed <currency>250</currency> (<currency>200</currency> for a renewal of her subscription, plus a
 * <currency>50</currency> prorating adjustment for half of the previous month’s <currency>100</currency> difference).
 * Similarly, a downgrade generates a credit that is applied to the next invoice. We also prorate when you make quantity
 * changes.</p>
 *
 * <p>Switching prices does not normally change the billing date or generate an immediate charge
 * unless:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The billing interval is changed (for example, from monthly to yearly).</li>
 * <li>The subscription
 * moves from free to paid, or paid to free.</li>
 * <li>A trial starts or ends.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In these cases, we apply a
 * credit for the unused time on the previous price, immediately charge the customer using the new price, and reset the
 * billing date.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you want to charge for an upgrade immediately, pass <code>proration_behavior</code> as
 * <code>always_invoice</code> to create prorations, automatically invoice the customer for those proration adjustments,
 * and attempt to collect payment. If you pass <code>create_prorations</code>, the prorations are created but not
 * automatically invoiced. If you want to bill the customer for the prorations before the subscription’s renewal date, you
 * need to manually <a href="/docs/api/invoices/create">invoice the customer</a>.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you don’t want to prorate, set
 * the <code>proration_behavior</code> option to <code>none</code>. With this option, the customer is billed
 * <currency>100</currency> on May 1 and <currency>200</currency> on June 1. Similarly, if you set
 * <code>proration_behavior</code> to <code>none</code> when switching between different billing intervals (for example,
 * from monthly to yearly), we don’t generate any credits for the old subscription’s unused time. We still reset the
 * billing date and bill immediately for the new subscription.</p>
 *
 * <p>Updating the quantity on a subscription many times
 * in an hour may result in <a href="/docs/rate-limits">rate limiting</a>. If you need to bill for a frequently changing
 * quantity, consider integrating <a href="/docs/billing/subscriptions/usage-based">usage-based billing</a> instead.</p>
